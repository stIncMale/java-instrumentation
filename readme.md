# Java Instrumentation
Contains an article and code examples of Java class file transformation. The article describes what Java instrumentation and class file transformation is, what mechanisms Java Platform SE provides for the instrumentation purposes, and provides examples of Java class file transformation. All examples are ready to run and you only need an installed JRE to execute them.

It's assumed that a reader is familiar with Java programming language and have an idea about what JRE is. However a reader can have absolutely no idea about Java instrumentation. The purpose of the article is to provide the basic knowledge so even programmer that is absolutely unfamiliar with Java class file transformation can work in this direction on his own after studying the article and examples.
